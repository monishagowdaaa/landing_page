        <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
          <p>Loving the work we do is one thing that led to our creation of Be Theme. The real driver however was suggestions and feedback from our customers. It’s always great to know that your customers are happy, but what really is great, is when your customers offer their ideas and suggestions as to what they would like to see.<br>
            Different customers, and their clients, have different needs, and they require many different solutions. This knowledge led us to create Be Theme, a WordPress theme in which we planned to present demos that would enable our customers to choose layouts that met their immediate needs. We also wanted them to be able to do so easily.<br>
            One thing led to another of course, and we began to create and add more and more pre-made layouts. As a result, Be Theme became bigger and better, and it is still growing. There was also the matter of showing our customers what they could do with our pre-made layouts, and how easy it can be to build websites using them, which is what we touch upon next.

            <h4>Eye Pallate</h4>
            <p>
              They come in a variety of sizes, finishes (matte, shimmer, metallic), and color ranges  to create different eye looks.

            <h4>Gloss</h4>
            <p>
              Sheer and shiny, lip glosses add a touch of color and plumpness to the lips.

            <h4>Cream foundation</h4>
            <p>
               Cream foundations are thicker than liquid foundations and offer full coverage. They are a good option for dry skin.
